	  This driver supports the builtin ethernet ports on Cavium
	  Inc.' products in the Octeon family. This driver supports the
	  CN3XXX, CN5XXX, CN6XXX and CNF7XXX OCTEON processors.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.  The module
	  will be called octeon-ethernet.

	  This option enables a very simple ethernet driver for internal core
	  to core traffic. It relies on another driver, octeon-ethernet,
	  to perform all hardware setup. This driver's purpose is to supply
	  basic networking between different Linux images running on the same
	  chip. A single core loads the octeon-ethernet module, all other cores
	  load this driver. On load, the driver waits for some other core to
	  perform hardware setup.
