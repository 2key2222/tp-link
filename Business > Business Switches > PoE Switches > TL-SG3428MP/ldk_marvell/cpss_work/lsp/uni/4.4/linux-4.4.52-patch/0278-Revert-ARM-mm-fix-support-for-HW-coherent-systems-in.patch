Subject: [PATCH 0278/2241] Revert "ARM: mm: fix support for HW coherent
 systems in PL310 cache"

This patch reverts the PL310 removal of L2 operations due to HWCC
system. This is done because of a new (and dymanic) way to find this
configuration and remove the L2 operations.
The new implementation is introduced in the followin patches.

This reverts 'commit c4e4d88303a0 ("ARM: dma-mapping: Don't use
outer_flush_range when the L2C is coherent")'.
